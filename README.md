Information
======================================================================

An example of a simple Memory Game (match pairs) developed in openFL (Flash &amp; HTML5), createJS (javascript) and pixiJS (javascript)

I'd like to say, for the record, that <b>the game is not 100% finished.</b> It's a very first versiod and there's room for a ton of improvements, optimizations, etc. The most complete version is the one developed with createJS, because is using the amazing TweenMax libraries to make the animations, alpha's, etc. (pixiJS still doesn't support a full use of the library).

<b>IMPORTANT</b> &rarr; The folders <i><b>'assets'</b></i> and <i><b>'js'</b></i> are shared by all the 3 games.

For testing the games, the best way is to do it on a localhost on your computer. Other way, some of the games won't properly works (cross domain permissions, etc).

Purpose
======================================================================

The main purpose of this experiment is to try to make a simple game as fast as I can with some different technologies out there.

My background has always been Flash & AS3 so I wanted to make a quick port, first to openFL (Haxe) and then some amazing HTML5 frameworks like pixiJS (i love it) or createJS (solid and very 'Flashy'). The great thing about openFL is that is cross-platform. I exported my code to FLASH and HTML5 in no time (really, only a few minor changes) and then I downloaded createJS and pixiJS to give them a try.

To be honest, the major HTML5 frameworks out there are very similar to FLASH API, so it was no difficult at all to port the code to javascript. The result of that experiments are 3 different kind of codes but the same result (although the createJS version has more animations thanks to TweenMax JS).

Technologies
======================================================================

<b>OpenFL</b> (http://www.openfl.org/) &rarr; OpenFL is an exciting cross-platform framework that targets Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Flash and HTML5.

<b>CreateJS</b> (http://www.createjs.com/) &rarr; A suite of Javascript libraries & tools for building rich, interactive experiences with HTML5.

<b>pixiJS</b> (http://www.goodboydigital.com/blog/) &rarr; 2D webGL framework with canvas fallback.


Personal choices
======================================================================

If you wanna develop </b>cross platform apps</b>, go for openFL. Haxe Is easy and very similar to AS3. :)

If you prefer to develop <b>pure javascript</b> and wanna get <b>amazing speed</b>, go for pixiJS. (it's still a very young framework but it will be amazing with some improvements)

Finally, if you are an <b>AS3 programmer</b> and wanna switch to JS, go for createJS.
